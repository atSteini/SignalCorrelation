# Signal Correlation
A project that demonstrates, how different signals can be correlated. Work for a school project :school_satchel:.

This project uses code from one of my other projects: [Fourier Analysis](https://github.com/atSteini/FourierAnalysis). There were some bugs in the old version, that are fixed here.

## 📦 Packages
This project uses npm packages. Run `npm install` in folder.
